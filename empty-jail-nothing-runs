The FreeBSD jail which runs within an ingress node does nothing but extract values
from Makefile.  This is done mostly via `make -V PORTVERSION` (for example).

We don't need syslog, cron, periodic, etc.

To that end, this is placed in /etc/rc.conf:

cron_enable="NO"
syslogd_enable="NO"
sendmail_enable="NO"
sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"

* /usr/ports is updated via git from outside the jail
* scripts, located in / within the jail, extract the required information
* pkg is not installed within the jail
